> This repository has a hundred common Javascript/typescript problems to practice to improve your js skills better to become comfortable with doing Javascript problems that may arise during the tech interviews. There are videos to assist if you get stuck on Udemy; the URL for these problems and videos can is  https://www.udemy.com/course/100-algorithms-challenge. I primarily do not use the videos, and if stuck, look through MDN or w3schools for methods that will provide the solution I might need. This way of solving practice problems will help the developer in multiple ways; it familiarizes you with js methods and solutions. It helps to develop an understanding of how to read documentation speak.
